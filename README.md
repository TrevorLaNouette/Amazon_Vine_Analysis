# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to determine the bias of paid vs unpaid reviews in selected category of amazon products. The category I selected was "Digital Video Games". I pulled data from AWS which included only reviews in this category.

## Results:

- How many Vine (Paid) reviews and non-Vine(Unpaid) reviews were there?

## Summary:
My data did not contain any bias as pertaining to paid vs unpaid reviews as there were no paid reviews in the data set. Additional analysis of other product categories that contain paid reviews would need to be conducted to determine if paid vs unpaid bias towards average review (star rating) exist.
