# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of the analysis was to determine the bias of paid vs unpaid reviews in selected category of amazon products. The category I selected was "Digital Video Games". I pulled data from AWS which included only reviews in this category.

## Results:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

Summary: My data did not contain any bias as pertaining to paid vs unpaid reviews as there were not paid reviews in the data set. Additional analysis on other categories of amazon products that contain paid reviews would need to be conducted to determine if the paid vs unpaid average review (star rating) differ significantly.
